## Hello!

The content for this website home page is in the `index.md` file. When GitHub Pages turns a repository into a website it looks for one of these files (in descending order) to use as the home page:

- index.html
- index.md
- readme.md

> [!NOTE]
> Markdown files are always published as html in GitHub pages sites. For example, the content in `resources.md` is published at a URL ending in _resources.**html**_ 



### Using Markdown syntax

Webpages can be written in _HTML_ or _Markdown_. This example uses Markdown, which is shorter and more readable as plain text. See these resources to learn more about Markdown:

- [Basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


### Site navigation

Each Markdown and html file in your repository becomes a web page. Pages appear in the navigation menu by default, and you can link to them directly. 

Here's a link to the [Configuring your site](configure-site.md) page, for example, which demonstrates how to set a website title, choose a theme, etc.
